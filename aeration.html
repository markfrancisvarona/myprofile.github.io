	<h1>Automated Aeration and Water Qualities Monitoring System</h1></div>
   <div class=xtext>
	<p>The objective of water quality monitoring is to obtain quantitative information on the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of water via statistical sampling. Aeration is used in liquids, soils and foods to improve quality and reduce contamination. The process is used to oxidize soluble iron and manganese to insoluble precipitates. Aeration can also reduce ammonia and hydrogen sulfide and is ideal for bacteria control.</p></div>
